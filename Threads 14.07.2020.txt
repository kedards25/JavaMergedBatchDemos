Benefits of Threading
	Improved performance
	Minimized resource usage
	Simplified programming structure

Limitations of Threading
	Race Condition
		Multiple threads trying to get memory access and 		finally no one gets it
	Deadlock
		One thread is waiting for second one to complete and 
		second is waiting for first one to complete

	Livelock
		for(int i=10;i>0,i++)
		{	}
	Lock starvation
		One thread with low priority is waiting for another 		thread to complete its work and by the time it 		finishes its work a thread with higher priority 		enters,so the thread with low priority times out

Life cycle of thread
	new(not started)	//Thread is declared but not started 
	runnable(Started)	//Thread is running
	not runnable		//Thread is in sleep/wait/suspended
	dead			//Thread is no more active
