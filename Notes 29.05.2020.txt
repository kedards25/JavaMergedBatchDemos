String is a class and a data type both

String as a data type is a reference type

Object of String class can be treated as an object

String is immutable class
	immutable=>not changing
	if an object of String class is assigned a value
	it cannot be assigned with new value(cannot be overwritten)
	it will allocate a new memory and old value still be there in 	memory

but reference variables of String class are mutable

	String str=new String("Kedar");
	str=new String("Adwait");
