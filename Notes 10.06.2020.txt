Types of errors
	Compile Time(Syntax Error)=>misplaced or missing ,;""{[
	Logical Error	=>e.g for program of addition we are using *
	Runtime Error	=>Errors that may occur at runtime
				errors may or may not occur

To handle runtime errors we should use try...catch block
we should put the code which may generate an error in try block
and try to execute
if there is an error an exception will be raised and the same will be handled by catch block
		
checked exceptions are the ones which may occur at runtime and
compiler is aware of and it prompts us to handle that error while writing the code

unchecked exceptions are the ones which may occur at runtime and
compiler is unaware of and it will not prompt us to handle that error while writing the code

in case we do not know the exact exception being thrown
we can throw an object of parent class of all exceptions ie exception class which wraps all the objects of exception class

in order to close the external resources which we have opened irrespective of error we should use finally block
finally block executes irrespective of error
