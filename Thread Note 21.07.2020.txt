Whenever we have an option to extend a class or to implement an interface,always go for implementing interface because class can extend only one class but can extend multiple interfaces and a class together
e.g.1
class DemoP
{

}
//we cannot extend DemoP in this case
class ThrDemo extends Thread
{

}

e.g.2
class DemoP
{

}
//we can extend DemoP in this case
class ThrDemo extends DemoP implements Runnable
{

}
