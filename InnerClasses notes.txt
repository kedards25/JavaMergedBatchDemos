Limitations of inheritance
	Parent cannot access child properties
	
	Child class cannot inherit parent's private properties


To overcome the limitations of inheritance we have a feature called as inner classes or nested classes
Inner classes:
	Inner classes are the ones which are defined within body of 	parent class

Static Nested class:
	If members of innerClasses are declared with static modifier,
	then the class is called as Static Nested class

Method Local InnerClasses:
	Method Local InnerClasses are the ones which are declared 	within the body of method in parent class

Anonymous Class
	Anonymous classes are the ones where one of the class is 	unknown,basically this unknown class is accessed from default 	package i.e. java.lang
	Compiler expects two classes in program but does not get it
	so it creates .class file for anonymous class with the same 	name as that of className but with $1 suffix.
